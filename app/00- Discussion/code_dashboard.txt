              <p>The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study.
               The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals. Get a to-do list and a timer. Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings. When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed. Then enjoy a five-minute break. After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.</p>
